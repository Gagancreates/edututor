# Phase 2: Enhanced Features and Script Integration

## Overview
Phase 2 builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1 by adding script generation alongside the Manim code. This phase focuses on creating a synchronized educational experience where the narration script aligns perfectly with the visual content. We'll also implement additional features to enhance the user experience and educational value.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Script Generation Enhancement
1. **Update Gemini Prompt Engineering**
   - Enhance the prompt to generate both Manim code and a synchronized script
   - Structure the prompt to request time-coded narration that matches visual elements
   - Example prompt structure:
   ```
   Generate:
   1. Manim code that explains [topic]
   2. A narration script with timestamps that align with the animation
   Format the response as:
   {
     "manim_code": "...",
     "script": [
       {"time": "0-5s", "narration": "..."},
       {"time": "5-10s", "narration": "..."},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Response Parsing**
   - Update the response parser to extract both Manim code and script
   - Validate the script format and structure
   - Handle edge cases where script timing might not align with animation

### 2. Text-to-Speech Integration
1. **Set up TTS Service**
   - Integrate a text-to-speech service (options: Google TTS, Azure Speech, etc.)
   - Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-texttospeech # or equivalent
   ```

2. **Create TTS Service Module**
   ```
   backend/
   └── app/
       └── services/
           └── tts.py  # Text-to-speech service
   ```

3. **Implement Script-to-Audio Conversion**
   - Convert each script segment to audio
   - Apply appropriate voice, tone, and pacing for educational content
   - Save audio files with timestamps for synchronization

### 3. Audio-Video Synchronization
1. **Set up FFmpeg Integration**
   - Create a service for handling media processing
   ```
   backend/
   └── app/
       └── services/
           └── media.py  # Media processing service
   ```

2. **Implement Audio-Video Merging**
   - Combine Manim-generated video with TTS-generated audio
   - Ensure proper synchronization based on script timestamps
   - Handle timing adjustments if necessary

3. **Create Final Video Assembly Pipeline**
   - Implement a workflow that:
     1. Generates Manim video
     2. Generates audio from script
     3. Synchronizes and merges them
     4. Produces a final MP4 with proper encoding

### 4. Enhanced Frontend Features
1. **Update Video Player Component**
   - Enhance `app/video/page.tsx` to display synchronized subtitles
   - Add transcript display alongside the video
   - Implement interactive transcript navigation (click on text to jump to that point)

2. **Implement Progress Tracking**
   - Create a real-time progress tracking system
   - Update the frontend to show actual generation progress:
     - Prompt analysis
     - Manim code generation
     - Video rendering
     - Audio generation
     - Final assembly

3. **Add Interactive Controls**
   - Implement chapter/section navigation based on script segments
   - Add playback speed controls
   - Create a "replay section" feature

### 5. User Experience Improvements
1. **Implement History Feature**
   - Store user's previously generated videos
   - Create a history page to access past generations
   ```
   app/
   └── history/
       └── page.tsx
   ```

2. **Add Feedback Mechanism**
   - Create a feedback component for users to rate video quality
   - Store feedback for future improvements

3. **Implement Loading States and Error Handling**
   - Create better loading animations
   - Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed generations

### 6. Backend Enhancements
1. **Optimize Manim Rendering**
   - Implement quality settings (low, medium, high)
   - Add options for different visual styles
   - Optimize rendering speed

2. **Enhance Caching System**
   - Implement more sophisticated caching based on semantic similarity
   - Store intermediate results (Manim code, script, etc.) for faster regeneration
   - Create a cache management system

3. **Implement Queue System**
   - Create a job queue for handling multiple generation requests
   - Use a task queue like Celery or RQ
   ```bash
   pip install celery redis
   ```
   ```
   backend/
   └── app/
       └── tasks/
           ├── __init__.py
           └── queue.py  # Task queue configuration
   ```

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
1. **Create Comprehensive Tests**
   - Unit tests for each service
   - Integration tests for the full pipeline
   - End-to-end tests for user flows

2. **Implement Quality Metrics**
   - Video quality assessment
   - Audio clarity checks
   - Synchronization validation

3. **Conduct User Testing**
   - Get feedback on the educational value
   - Test with different topics and complexity levels
   - Iterate based on user feedback

## Technical Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the entire pipeline for speed
   - Implement parallel processing where possible
   - Use efficient encoding settings

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor CPU/memory usage during video generation
   - Implement resource limits to prevent overload
   - Create cleanup routines for temporary files

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline
   - Create fallback mechanisms for each step
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Completion Criteria
Phase 2 is complete when:
1. The system generates both Manim code and synchronized narration script
2. The script is converted to high-quality audio
3. Audio and video are perfectly synchronized in the final output
4. The frontend displays subtitles and transcript alongside the video
5. Users can interact with the video through enhanced playback controls
6. The system handles multiple requests efficiently through queuing
7. All components are thoroughly tested and optimized
