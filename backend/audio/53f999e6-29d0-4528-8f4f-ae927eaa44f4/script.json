    "text": "At its heart, the Laplace Transform is defined by an improper integral. It takes a function of time, f(t), and multiplies it by an exponential term, e to the power of negative s t, then integrates from zero to infinity. This integral converts the time-domain function into a new function in the frequency domain, denoted F(s). The variable 's' is a complex frequency parameter, which captures both real and imaginary components.",

    "text": "Let's look at a couple of simple examples to see the Laplace Transform in action. First, the Laplace Transform of the constant function, f(t) = 1. After applying the integral definition, we find that the Laplace Transform of 1 is simply 1 over s. Next, consider the exponential function, f(t) = e to the power of a t. This transforms into 1 over the quantity s minus a, a fundamental result. These examples demonstrate how functions in the time domain have corresponding representations in the frequency domain.",
