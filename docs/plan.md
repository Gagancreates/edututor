# EduTutor Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
EduTutor is an AI-powered educational platform that generates custom educational videos based on user prompts. The system uses Gemini API to generate Manim code and narration scripts, which are then rendered into educational videos with synchronized audio.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Local Development with Manim Integration
**Goal**: Create a working prototype with local storage and computation.

**Key Deliverables**:
- FastAPI backend integration with Gemini API
- Manim code generation and execution pipeline
- Basic video serving capabilities
- Frontend integration with the existing Next.js application

**Technical Focus**:
- Setting up the development environment
- Implementing the core generation pipeline
- Creating a seamless user experience for video generation

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features and Script Integration
**Goal**: Add synchronized narration and enhanced user experience.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Script generation alongside Manim code
- Text-to-speech integration
- Audio-video synchronization
- Enhanced frontend features (subtitles, transcript, controls)
- User experience improvements (history, feedback)

**Technical Focus**:
- Perfecting the synchronization between visuals and narration
- Enhancing the educational value of generated content
- Improving system performance and reliability

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

### Phase 3: Production Readiness and Deployment
**Goal**: Transform the application into a production-ready system.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Cloud infrastructure setup
- Microservices architecture
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Security and authentication
- Monitoring and observability
- CI/CD pipeline

**Technical Focus**:
- Ensuring the system can scale to handle production loads
- Implementing security best practices
- Creating a robust, maintainable architecture

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
